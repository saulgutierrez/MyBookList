# MyBookList
Simple Web Based CRUD to add and delete books entries.

Using JS class, I created 3 different types of objects, that represents the entities of the application.
<li> Book: Represents the basic properties of a book: title, author and ISBN.
<li> UI: Includes the basic functions of the application: add a book, delete a book, show alerts and clear fields.
<li> Store: Fetch and save the information of a book in the LocalStorage of the browser, therefore, these don't lose when you close the browser, only can be deleted, from the LocalStorage. 

Moreover, shows up alerts for every action the user makes, such as delete an item, add an item, or update an item, or try to save a empty string. Includes responsive design.

Technologies used:

<li> HTML
<li> Bootswatch
<li> Vanilla JS
<li> FontAwesome
